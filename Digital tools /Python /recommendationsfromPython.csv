It's a breath of fresh air among all the terrible slasher movies out there nowadays. It doesn't quite revolutionize the slasher genre, but it is definitely a strong comeback. Shari Vinson was magnificent as Erin. She is definitely one of the greatest horror movie leading ladies of all time. She was smart, fierce and an all around bad-ass. The other characters are pretty shallow, spoiled and  two dimensional but when you see this movie you'll understand how it's makes up for this little flaw.  While the movie contained some jump scares, overall it wasn't scary, but that's pretty much standard for a slasher film. But what it lacks in scares it makes up tenfold in the gore department. This film is a roller coaster of carnage and it does so with finesse and panache and features one of the greatest horror movie deaths of all time. This film was getting major hype way before it premiered and by God, it delivers with intensity and ferocity that needs to be experienced way more than once."" ]";5;7.0;5.0;2.0;;inf;10

It had great characters and an extremely smart and suspenseful plot. Then David Fincher's version of the film came out and totally blew the original out of the water. The characters were fleshed out more, especially the exquisite Lisbeth Salander played beautifully by Rooney Mara, who totally deserved Best Actress over Meryl Streep's wooden Margaret Thatcher. To put it bluntly, Mara's Lisbeth was a total bad ass, which was extremely needed. She played the character to a T and was more convincing than Noomi Rapace's portrayal (no offense Noomi). Daniel Craig also did a great job at playing Mikael and did the character more justice. The film was long but the length was needed. It took out all the filler nonsense of the original film and added more well-needed detail and style. David Fincher redeems himself a hundred times over after giving us the utterly terrible \""Social Network\"" and re-instilled much needed faith back into his film making capabilities. It was taut, sleek, stylish, suspenseful and utterly provocative. Dark, graphic, and disturbing are age old trademarks of Fincher (see Fight Club and Seven) and he went and brought them back with a vengeance in this beautifully crafted and well-needed improvement to \""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"" series and can't wait to see what wonder Fincher brings to the table with the sequels."" ]";0;0.0;0.0;0.0;;inf;10

It is simply the best film I've ever seen. Number one Natalie Portman was phenominal in her role as Nina. It was a very hard role, and she had it doen to a T.  She totally desereved her Oscar. The real star though is Darren Aronofsky. His direction in this film was absolutley breathtaking. He is one of the best filmmakers left in Hollywood. His movies are always good, if not great. The way he directed this film was a spooky and creepy. The way the classical music was used in this film was absolutley genius. The cinematography in every scene was excellent. It created the tension for the film and never let you go until the last moment. The use of black and white as symbolism was also a very good mood and the love scene between Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis was beautiful. It wasn't gratuitous or exploitative. It was forced or thrown in. It went with the movie.  The film creeped me out, it had at the edge of my seat and at that final moment, it had me tearing up. Why didn't this movie win any more Oscars?

It is a great looking movie and some interesting scenes especially the shootout where Llewellyn and Anton first butt heads, but that's about it. First off, I thought Anton Chigurh was a terrible character. Everyone says how menacing he is, but he's just ridiculous. Secondly, I don't get Tommy Lee Jones significance.

saw-3d;2;Wolfmother;/user/Wolfmother;Oct 31;2010;"[ ""spoilers: Im a big fan of saw and loved all 6 of them. But saw 7 was just disappointing. Saw 7 was supposed to be the collision of ALL 6 movies combined. We wanted to know more about the man we have been waiting to see for the past 7 years.(Gordon) The justification for Bobby and his victims were so dumb. If you like watching people die then you will like it. There are plenty of loose ends and you would think that there would be a saw 8 because of the unanswered questions. Why has Gordon assisted Jigsaw? What happened to Easton's killers,sister, and saved victims? Why did they just lazily scrap the 2 victims of saw 5? What happened to Gordon's family? I assume the other 2 pigmaks resemble Gordon's appretinces as he takes on the rightful role as Jiggsaw. Now, the point of Bobby was so that since he could not understand the pain of being a victim, he had no power to save others, but he did. He helped alot of people appreciate life. Who cares if he lied, he may have been in it for fame and fortune but what he got wasnt justified, it was a cheap excuse to put more traps. Bobby's victims were even more innocent. You put in traps because you dont appreciate life or your ruining someone elses. They didnt do either. There wasnt much of Tobin(Jiggsaw), he only had like 1 scene. Saw1-6 were true to the series giving deserving punishments with great twists. But saw 7 wasnt. You would expect the last one to be the best. Why didnt Gordon return for Adam? Throughout the movie, your supposed to be fixated on Hoffman and Bobby, but the fans are obviously on their toes, waiting for Gordon. Many things are unanswered but to be honest, its somewhat implied. But we really want to see why Gordon became the new Jiggsaw. Saw has a knack for giving us a great ending that will make us want to come back to see the sequel so we can find the answers to the questions we have been wondering. Saw 7 does the same except provides no sequels so no answers. People criticize it for saw 7 trying to tie up loose ends instead of tell a story, but they didnt even tie up the loose ends, some of it is still loose.

The acting was good and some of the comedy moments were actually pretty funny (Hollywood Squares, anyone?). Of course, seeing as it was shot in the modern era of the zombie flick, there is just enough blood and huts to satisfy any gorehound.

Michael Keaton stars as Bruce Wayne, a sly and unassuming businessman who by day deals with documents and contracts and who by night is a one man army, stopping crimes all over Gotham City. He forms a relationship with photojournalist Vicki Vale, played sexily by Kim Basinger, who wants to write a story about the Batman legend and crack the truth once and for all.

When these elements are combined, you get Die Hard, a 1988 rip-roaring action epic that shot Bruce Willis to international fame. The plot is delightfully simple; John McClane is a New York cop who is visiting his wife Holly in LA during Christmas Eve. He meets up with her at her business company's Christmas party. All goes well until a few uninvited guests in the form of creepy terrorists seize control of the building and take all 30 of the guests hostage, demanding a ransom. McClane, in the bathroom at their time of arrival, escapes into the unfinished skyscraper armed only with his standard issue 9mm at his disposal. His main objective; find out what the hell is going on. His only help is a flatfooted cop on the ground played by Reginald VelJohnson of Family Matters. Along the way, he is listening to radio messages between the villains with a stolen walkie talkie in an attempt to figure out their nefarious plan. Alan Rickman is great as Hans Gruber, leader of the baddies, and delivers a performance he echoes in the Harry Potter films as Prof. Severus Snape. One of the best movie villains of all time. This festival of explosions, guns and epic battles was directed by John McTiernan, famous already for the original Predator. He delivers a movie that entertains as well as it shocks. In particular, the sequence in which one of the hostages attempts to save his own life by offering McClane to the terrorists. Correctly anticipating a liar, Hans shoots him in the head. The film was one of the biggest box office hits of the 1980s and spawned three sequels throughout the 1990s and 2000s, firmly placing John McClane as an action hero alongside the Terminator and Rambo.

While I normally despise the overuse of CGI in modern cinema, this film is an example of how to use it both properly and effectively. The aliens look amazing and are nearly always perfectly in sync with the human characters. It is also a highly original concept; in most alien sci-fi films, the aliens come to Earth to destroy our planet, but here they want a peaceful co-existence with mankind, at least that is the basic premise of the plot. In other words, the cliche is reversed in that humans are seen as the main villains and not the aliens, due to the fact all the humans want to exploit the alien technology and make billions in profits. The film also sports some homages to earlier films of this genre, most notably Independence Day (1996), due to the huge mothership that is floating above the city of Johannes burg but never attacks or even moves, and of course the human-alien creature the main character gradually transforms into is a direct reference to The Fly, with similar make-up effects and scenes that show the phenomenon up close, without looking away.

You really felt a sense of the enormous evil that lay within the mansion and just like the main character were constantly on edge and dreaded the dark nights, knowing that the woman in black of the title would have even scarier things in store for you. Overall, I would say that this film was actually very good as a ghost story and despite a few flaws in its structure, it delivers a frightening thrill ride that stays in your memory long after you've seen it. In other words, it is nowhere near as bad as other critics say it is."" ]";0;0.0;0.0;0.0;;8.0;7
the-guard;8;TheNewSpielberg;/user/TheNewSpielberg;Apr 11;2012;"[ ""As an Irishman, I found this film to be very funny and hugely entertaining. I think the main reason this film didn't really work outside of Ireland is that most of the jokes concern Irish politics, culture and general life in Ireland, meaning a few foreign audiences found comedic moments plain confusing rather than hilarious. I also loved Brendan Gleeson's performance as the title character. He perfectly captures the personality and accent of a typical West Irish man and I feel he was a perfect choice for the role. I also thought that Don Cheadle was great too. The only thing I didn't like was that I thought that the Aidan McBride character was given too short of a role in the story and I would have liked to have seen him more, mostly because the chemistry between Sgt. Boyle and him was so great and for me it was a shame McBride was killed off so early in the film. But apart from that, I would easily say this is one of my 10 favorite films of all time."" ]";0;0.0;0.0;0.0;;8.0;7

The ghost effects I thought were really cool and the whole serial killer sub plot came totally out of the blue for me. In sum, a decent thriller that is a great movie to watch on Halloween."" ]";0;0.0;0.0;0.0;;7.0;6
titanic;7;TheNewSpielberg;/user/TheNewSpielberg;Apr  1;2011;"[ ""James Cameron's 1997 movie epic garnered instant acclaim upon release, grossed over 1 billion dollars at the box office (Avatar would beat this record over a decade later) and was given the dubious honor of being the most expensive production of all time. The plot tells of a poor steerage passenger named Jack Dawson who forms a romantic relationship with first class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater onboard the \""unsinkable\"" RMS Titanic. The film focuses mainly on the relationship between the duo up until the point the great ship strikes an iceberg and sinks rapidly, transforming it into a typical big budget summer blockbuster that tries to be more than just popcorn entertainment. The acting is decent, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet giving dramatic performances that are fueled by the romance between the two. Billy Zane is also good as Cal Hockley, a wealthy tycoon who plans to marry Rose. Overall, the film is good but one major complaint must be addressed. I think that the film uses one of the greatest tragedies in history to its advantage just a bit too much. Of course, Cameron had been on dives to the real wreck of the actual ship himself during filming and was very much moved by it, but his feelings and emotions towards the events are not portrayed very well on film. As is typical with many Hollywood epics, a small proportion of the what happens during the sinking is historically inaccurate but apart from that it leaves an overwhelming sense of grief upon you. Actually, that grief may be the reason why the film has received so much backlash in recent years, because the first time you see it, men and women will get teary-eyed in the end, but after a number of times it just isn't the same and you wish you were seeing it for the first time instead. All in all, a masterpiece as a standalone disaster film but a tad disappointing as a historically accurate Titanic film. If you wish to see a factual version, the 1958 film A Night to Remember may be more your cup of tea."" ]";2;2.0;2.0;0.0;;7.0;6
